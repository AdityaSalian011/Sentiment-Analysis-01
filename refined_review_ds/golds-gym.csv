7,7,Chintan Makwana,"DONT JOIN IF YOU ARE A FIRST TIME GYM GOER/NEWBEE/INEXPERIENCED. Subscribed for a yearly membership after hearing much hype about it being the best in Thane. But i was really disappointed specially from the point of view of a new member, i was never given that initial attention which is needed in the first week. On my first day I had to go by myself and ask trainer to give some schedule as a newbee. No exercise/progress card was made,inspite of me asking multiple times. No update on gym renovation closure was received on my registered mobile number. I lost the motivation. Trainers most of the time busy either watching TV or helping female members. Totally not worth the hype and also don't fall for the 50% monsoon offer. It is hardly few thousand bucks discount from the original cost. U wont recieve any call for retention if your membership is about to expire. They care a damn if u continue or leave.",NEGATIVE,The customer is disappointed with the gym's service.,The new member was never given initial attention.,The customer was not provided with an exercise schedule.,,"['customer disappointed gym', 'disappointed gym service', 'disappointed gym', 'customer disappointed']"

18,18,Amit Sabnis,"Somehow, over a course of last 5 years, Golds Gym in Thane has lost its charm and quality too. Moreover the cost of packages have sky-rocketed with not much appreciation or development on the gym floor and with same old machines.
A few exceptions like cross fit which are a trend look good. They still have the same approach on hiring a personal trainer which again costs you big buck. The regular trainers are always encouraging and motivating you to sign up into personal training, else ignoring you.
The discounts which happen yearly are not at all making any difference as they will lower the package cost only by 15% and are promoted as 50%.
They have to pull up their standard and be atleast little bit pocket friendly.
